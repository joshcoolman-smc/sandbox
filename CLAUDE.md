# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Design experiments sandbox for rapid visual exploration. Each experiment is a self-contained design exercise stored in dated folders.

## Development Commands

```bash
npm run dev      # Start dev server on port 3000 (auto-opens browser)
npm run build    # Build for production
npm run preview  # Preview production build
```

## Workflow for New Experiments

When the user says "new experiment" or shares an image to explore:

1. **Create dated folder**: `YYYY-MM-DD-descriptive-name/`
2. **Build experiment**: Create `index.html` inside folder
3. **Verify with browser**: Use agent-browser to check the design
4. **Document it**: Create `README.md` with:
   - Overview and key features
   - Design principles
   - How to run
   - Dependencies (fonts, libraries)
   - Screenshots reference
5. **Capture screenshot**:
   - Use agent-browser to take screenshot
   - Save to `/screenshots/experiment-name.png` (for homepage)
   - Also save to experiment's local `screenshots/` folder
6. **Update homepage**: Add entry to root `index.html` with:
   - Date
   - Title (linked to experiment)
   - Preview image: `<img src="./screenshots/experiment-name.png">`
   - One-line description
   - Tags
7. **Ship it**: Commit with descriptive message

## Workflow for Modifying Experiments

When updating an existing experiment:

1. **Make changes**: Edit the experiment's `index.html`
2. **Verify with browser**: Use agent-browser to check the updates
3. **Update screenshot**: Retake screenshot and save to `/screenshots/experiment-name.png`
4. **Move to top**: Reorder both `index.html` and `README.md` to move this experiment to the **top of the list**
   - This keeps most recently modified work visible first
   - Maintains chronological order by last activity, not creation date
5. **Update experiment README**: Add notes about what changed
6. **Ship it**: Commit with descriptive message noting the modifications

## Experiment README Template

```markdown
# Experiment Name

**Date:** Month Day, Year
**Type:** Brief categorization

## Overview
What it is and what it explores

## Key Features
- Bullet list of notable elements

## Design Principles
- Core aesthetic concepts

## How to Run
Steps to view the experiment

## Dependencies
- List external dependencies

## Screenshots
Reference to screenshots folder
```

## Design Philosophy

- **Self-contained**: Each experiment folder can be copied out independently
- **No build required**: Pure HTML/CSS when possible
- **Rapid exploration**: Focus on visual aesthetics over functionality
- **Documented**: Each experiment explains its design thinking
- **Chronological**: Easy to see design progression over time

## React-Based Experiments (with Vite)

Some experiments use React + Vite for interactivity. **Important setup notes:**

### Development Setup
- Navigate INTO the experiment folder: `cd 2026-01-28-experiment-name/`
- Run `pnpm dev` (or `npm run dev`) from inside the experiment folder
- Dev server runs on port 3000 and auto-opens browser
- Access at: `http://localhost:3000/` (NOT with folder path)

### File Structure
```
experiment-folder/
├── index.html          # Points to /src/main.jsx (dev) or ./assets/* (prod)
├── src/
│   ├── main.jsx        # React entry point
│   ├── App.jsx         # Main component
│   └── *.jsx           # Other components
├── assets/             # Built files (generated by build command)
├── package.json
└── vite.config.js
```

### Important: index.html Switching
- **Dev mode**: `index.html` must point to `/src/main.jsx`
- **Production**: `pnpm build` overwrites `index.html` to point to `./assets/index.js`
- **After building**: Restore dev version before running `pnpm dev` again

### Common Pitfall
- ❌ Navigating to `http://localhost:3000/folder-name/` → 404 error
- ✅ Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` → Works correctly
- The dev server serves the experiment at the root, not at a subfolder path

## Current Experiments
