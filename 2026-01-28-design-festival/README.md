## Overview

A modern card-based design system combining festival poster boldness with digital interface precision. Features LCD-style widgets, Swiss design typography, and a modular grid layout.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Calendar Widget**: Navigate weeks with smooth animations, select dates, auto-focuses on current week
- **React + react-spring Animations**: Physics-based transitions for week navigation
- **Metrics Dashboard**: Time/date display, progress bars, statistics
- **14+ Card Layouts**: Varied sizes using CSS Grid spanning
- **Swiss Design Rationale Section**: Modular grid with heavy rules
- **Google Fonts**: Inter for modern typography

## Design Principles

- Festival/event branding aesthetic (Sundance-inspired)
- LCD screen/smartwatch UI patterns
- Bold typography with tight spacing (700-800 weight)
- Asymmetric layouts with horizontal rule dividers
- Mix of sparse statement cards and dense data cards

## How to Run

### Production Build (GitHub Pages Ready)
Simply open `index.html` in a browser. The built files are already included.

### Development Mode
1. Navigate into the experiment folder:
   ```bash
   cd 2026-01-28-design-festival
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install  # or npm install
   ```
3. Start dev server:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev  # or npm run dev
   ```
4. Browser opens automatically to `http://localhost:3000/`

**Important:** The dev server is configured to run on port 3000 and will auto-open your browser.

### Build for Production
```bash
pnpm build  # or npm run build
```
⚠️ **Note:** This overwrites `index.html` to point to built assets. For dev work after building, you may need to restore the dev version of `index.html` that points to `/src/main.jsx`.

## Dependencies

- **React**: UI component library
- **react-spring**: Physics-based animation library
- **Vite**: Build tool and dev server
- **Google Fonts**: Inter (loaded from CDN)

The production build is self-contained and works on GitHub Pages.
